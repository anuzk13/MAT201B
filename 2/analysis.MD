### P3

When I change the symmetry of the forces some particles adquire strong orbits while others drift away

In this double orbit system a symmetry parameter makes one direction of the force weaker. As I increase the parameter one particle starts slowly drifting away while the other stays in an orbit around it

This behavior is less clear with more particles but the more I increase the symmetry parameter some particles tens to escape and others adquire more acceleration around an orbit.

### Point 4 alt:

New version of point 4. This version includes a force field that can 'trap' and redirect particles.

- Press 2 to move to the center of mass 

### Point 4:

- Inspired by the magnetic force on charged particles in a magnetic field I used the cross product instead of the difference as the direction for the gravitarional force and visualized it in the solar system
